## 1.3 Project Title
`[Batman Dodge]`

## 1.4 One-Line Pitch
`A fast-paced pixel-art Batman game controlled by a hand-built ESP32 dual-joystick console that transmits inputs wirelessly over BLE and lights up a NeoPixel in real time to mirror every in-game action.`

## 1.5 Expanded Project Idea
In 1–2 paragraphs, explain:
- what your project is,
- what kind of playful experience it creates,
- what makes it fun, curious, engaging, strange, satisfying, competitive, or delightful,
- what technologies are involved.

**Response:**  
`The project is a 2D pixel-art game (BATMANNER) where Batman navigates a city landscape, dodging obstacles and enemies. All player input comes from a custom physical console built around an ESP32 microcontroller with two HW-504 analogue joysticks. The console pairs to the game host over Bluetooth Low Energy, appearing as a standard HID keyboard so no special drivers are needed.
The experience combines embodied physical control with reactive lighting feedback. A single WS2812B NeoPixel breathes continuously and changes colour in real time based on which action is being performed — yellow for movement, orange for strafing, cyan for dash, green for fire, red for pause — creating an immediate sensory link between what the player does physically and what happens on screen. This makes the console feel alive, not just functional.`

# 2. Philosophy Fit

## 2.1 Experience, Not Social Problem
This module does **not** require your project to solve a large social problem.

You are allowed to build:
- toys,
- games,
- interactive objects,
- playful machines,
- kinetic artifacts,
- humorous devices,
- strange but delightful experiences,
- things that are entertaining to use or watch.

## 2.2 What kind of experience are you creating?
Answer the following:
- What is the experience?
- What do you want the player or participant to feel?
- Why would someone want to try it again?

**Response:**  
`[- Experience: A reflex-based arcade dodging game played through a hand-held physical console with live colour feedback on every action.
- Feeling: rgency and presence — the glowing controller makes it feel like the hardware itself is reacting, not just the screen.
- Replay value: Increasing difficulty, score competition, and the tactile satisfaction of the joystick + light response loop make each run feel immediate and replayable]`

## 3.2 Original Twist
What makes your project original?

**Response:**  
`[Most physical game controllers are generic. Here, the NeoPixel on the controller is wired directly into the game's action logic — it breathes white at rest, turns cyan on a dash, green on fire, red on ESC — so the controller itself narrates the game state. Combined with the one-way mirror installation, this creates a hybrid physical-digital experience that a phone or standard gamepad cannot replicate.]`

# 4. Project Intent

## 4.1 Core Interaction Loop
Describe the main loop of interaction.

Examples:
- press → launch → score → reset
- connect → control → observe → repeat
- turn → trigger → react → repeat
- move object → sensor detects → sound/light response → player reacts

**Response:**  
`[move joystick → ESP32 reads ADC → BLE keyboard report sent → game character responds → NeoPixel colour changes → player reacts → repeat]`

## 4.2 Intended Player / Audience

| Question | Response |
|---|---|
| Who is this for? | `[Students / exhibition visitors]` |
| Age range | `[10–25]` |
| Solo or multiplayer | `[Solo]` |
| Expected duration of one round | `[30–60 seconds per round]` |
| What should the player feel? | `[Tension and excitement]` |
| Is explanation required before use? | `[Minimal]` |

## 4.3 Player Journey
Describe exactly how a player will use the project.

1. **Approach:** `[Player walks up to what appears to be a normal mirror in a dark frame.]`
2. **Start:** `[Light sensor detects presence; game activates and becomes visible through the one-way mirror. Player picks up the ESP32 console]`
3. **First Action:** `[Batman begins moving automatically. Player pushes the left joystick to steer, NeoPixel turns yellow (W/S) or orange (A/D) instantly.]`
4. **Main Interaction:** `[Player steers Batman with the left stick (WASD), uses the right stick to flip direction (H/L), dash downward (J), and fires with the right button (F). The NeoPixel cycles through cyan, green, purple, orange in direct response.]`
5. **System Response:** `[All 4 lives lost → game over screen visible through the mirror..]`
6. **Win / Lose / End Condition:** `[How does one round end?]`
7. **Reset:** `[Game resets automatically or on player input; mirror returns to idle reflection state.]`

## 4.4 Rules of Play
If your project is a game, list the rules clearly.

- `[Batman moves continuously; the player must steer and dodge.]`
- `[Left joystick controls directional movement (W=up, S=down, A=left, D=right).]`
- `[Right joystick left/right triggers a directional flip (H / L keys).]`
- `[Right joystick pushed down triggers a dash (J key).]`
- `[Right joystick button fires (F key) , Left joystick button pauses / opens menu (ESC key).]`
- `[Player has 4 lives; losing all lives ends the round.]`
- `[Difficulty increases progressively with each level.]`

# 5. Definition of Success

## 5.1 Definition of “Playable”
Your project will be considered complete only if these conditions are met.

- [ ] `[he mirror convincingly appears as a normal reflective surface when idle and transitions clearly into a game display when activated.]`
- [ ] `[Players are able to understand and start interacting with the system with minimal instructions.]`
- [ ] `[Joystick controls feel responsive and allow smooth movement, attack, and dash actions (BLE loop runs at 50 Hz / 20 ms per cycle; deadzone set to 600/4095 ADC units).]`

## 5.2 Minimum Viable Version
What is the smallest version of this project that still delivers the core experience?

**Response:**  
`[A hand-held ESP32 console with both joysticks, and BLE keyboard pairing, running the BATMANNER game on an iPad. Core loop is: move, dodge, fire, lose a life — with NeoPixel confirming each action in colour.]`

## 6.2 High-Level System Description
Explain how the system works in simple terms.

Include:
- input,
- processing,
- output,
- physical structure,
- app interaction if any.

**Response:**  
`[The ESP32 reads two analogue HW-504 joysticks (4 ADC channels + 2 digital button pins) at 50 Hz. On each loop, it compares the deflection against a calibrated centre value and a deadzone of 600 ADC units (out of 4095). If a direction is active, it assembles a 6-key HID keyboard report and sends it over BLE using the BLEKbdHold class, which holds keys down for as long as the stick is deflected — matching how a keyboard game expects input. Simultaneously, the NeoPixel breathes using a triangle-wave brightness function and changes colour based on which keys are active, with a 12-loop (~240 ms) linger so colours do not snap off the moment a stick returns to centre. The game (BATMANNER, built in GDevelop) runs on an iPad and receives keyboard events from the ESP32 as if they came from a standard Bluetooth keyboard.]`

## 6.3 Input / Output Map

| System Part | Type | What It Does |
|---|---|---|
| `[Joystick #1 and #2]` | Input | `[Left stick: W/A/S/D movement + ESC on click and Right stick: H/L flip, J dash, F fire on click ]` |

## 8.2 Mechanical Description
Describe the mechanism and what it is meant to do.

**Response:**  
`[The controller enclosure houses the ESP32, two HW-504 joystick modules, a NeoPixel LED, and wiring. The joystick shafts protrude through cut holes on the top face. The enclosure uses a hinged or snap-fit lid for access to electronics during development. The one-way mirror frame is a separate standing structure that holds the iPad behind an acrylic one-way mirror panel.]`

## 8.3 Motion Planning
If something moves, explain:
- what moves,
- what causes the movement,
- how far it moves,
- how fast it moves,
- what could go wrong.

**Response:**  
`[What moves: The joystick thumbsticks move mechanically on X and Y axes; the potentiometer inside the module converts this to a variable resistance read by the ESP32 ADC.
Cause: Thumb pressure from the player.
Range: Each axis sweeps 0–4095 ADC counts; the centre is calibrated at startup (30-sample average, typically ~1900–2100). The deadzone of 600 counts means deflection must exceed ~15% of full range before a keypress registers.
Speed: ADC is sampled every 20 ms (50 Hz loop).
What could go wrong: Joystick drift if the module is bumped during calibration; ADC noise on GPIO 34/35 (input-only pins on ESP32, no internal pull-up — ensure 3.3V supply is stable).]`

## 8.4 Simulation / CAD / Animation Before Making
If your project includes mechanical motion, document the digital planning before fabrication.

| `[Gdev]` | `[Link or screenshot]` | `[Basic ADC read and NeoPixel output before physical assembly]` |

## 8.5 Changes After Digital Testing
What changed after the CAD, animation, or simulation stage?

**Response:**  
`[Joystick hole spacing was adjusted after the first mdf mock-up — the original spacing made two-thumb operation uncomfortable. Final spacing: 80 mm centre-to-centre.]`

## 9.2 Wiring Plan
Describe the main electrical connections.

**Response:**  
`[Left Joystick (HW-504 #1):

VCC → ESP32 3.3V
GND → ESP32 GND
VRx → GPIO 32 (ADC1_CH4)
VRy → GPIO 33 (ADC1_CH5)
SW  → GPIO 25 (PULL_UP enabled in code)

# 10. Software Planning

## 10.1 Software Tools

| Tool / Platform | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `[MicroPython]` | `[Main controller firmware — ADC reading, BLE HID, NeoPixel control]` |
| `[Gdevelop]` | `[Game devloper for BATMANOR — handles all gameplay logic, collision, lives, levels]` |
| `[ble_keyboard.py library]` | `[BLE HID keyboard abstraction used by the ESP32 firmware]` |
| `[Thonny IDE]` | `[Flash and run MicroPython scripts on the ESP32]` |


## 10.2 Software Logic
Describe what the code must do.

Include:
- startup behavior,
- input handling,
- sensor reading,
- decision logic,
- output behavior,
- communication logic,
- reset behavior.

**Response:**  
`[Startup:

NeoPixel runs a 5-colour startup flash (R→Y→G→B→Purple) to confirm wiring.
BLE advertising begins; NeoPixel breathes white (COL_WAITING) until paired.
Both joysticks are calibrated: 30 ADC samples are averaged to find the resting centre on each axis. No sticks should be touched during this phase.

Main loop (20 ms / 50 Hz):

Read left joystick: ADC on GPIO 32 (X) and GPIO 33 (Y), subtract calibrated centre, apply deadzone (±600 counts). Map result to KEY_W/A/S/D. Read button on GPIO 25 → KEY_ESC.
Read right joystick: ADC on GPIO 34 (X) and GPIO 35 (Y), subtract calibrated centre, apply deadzone. Map X-left → KEY_H, X-right → KEY_L, Y-down → KEY_J. Read button on GPIO 26 → KEY_F.
Compare current key set to previous. If changed, send a new 8-byte BLE HID report (modifier + 0 + 6 keycodes, packed with struct.pack("8B")).
Pick NeoPixel colour by priority: F (green) > ESC (red) > J (cyan) > H/L (purple) > W/S (yellow) > A/D (orange) > idle (white). After release, linger colour holds for 12 loops (~240 ms) before fading to white.
Advance the breathing triangle wave one step (±1/40 per loop, reversing at min/max brightness 0.10–1.00).
If BLE disconnects mid-session, NeoPixel returns to COL_WAITING and the loop continues waiting for reconnection.

Reset: No explicit reset needed — releasing all inputs sends a zero-key HID report; game handles its own round reset on life loss.]`

## 10.3 Code Flowchart


Suggested sequence:
- start,
- initialize,
- wait for input,
- read input,
- decision,
- trigger output,
- repeat or reset,
- error handling.

# 12. Bill of Materials

## 12.1 Full BOM

| Item | Quantity | In Kit? | Need to Buy? | Estimated Cost | Material / Spec | Why This Choice? |
|---|---:|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `[ESP32]` | `1` | `Yes` | `Yes` | QTY -`4` | 2040 Rupees | `[ESP32WROOM-Bluetooth/wifi]` | `[Main MicroPython Device]` |
| `[18650 Battery]` | `[No]` | `[Yes]` | QTY - '1' |`[100 Rupees]` | `[Power Source to have a wireless connection for ESP32]` |
| `Battery Holder` | `NO` | `[Yes]` | QTY - '1' | `[30 Rupees]` | `[PLastic Holder]` | `[Power Source aid]` |
| `[Joystick Module]` | `2` | `No` | `Yes` | 100 Rupees | `[E-348 - PS2 JOYSTICK MODULE BREAKOUT SENSOR]` | `[More interactive and matched our arcade themed game idea]` |
|`[Breadboard]` | `2` | `Yes` | `Yes` | 98 Rupees | `[RCT-159 - BREADBOARD - 400 POINTS]` | `[Multiple connections reqd two boards]` |
|`Push Buttons` | `6` | `Yes` | `Yes` |  36 Rupees | `[TC 15 12*12*7 mm ]` | `[More Buttons to add actions to the console]` |
|'Micro-USB cable' | '1' | 'Yes' | Yes | 120 Rupees | USB-A to Micro-B | Power + MicroPython flashing via Thonny |`
| 'One-way acrylic mirror sheet' | 1 | No | Yes | ₹1250 | 9 by 12 inches, 3 mm | Mirror installation for game display illusion |

## 12.2 Material Justification
Explain why you selected your main materials and components.

Examples:
- Why acrylic instead of cardboard?
- Why MDF instead of 3D print?
- Why servo instead of DC motor?
- Why bearing instead of a plain shaft hole?

**Response:**  
`[**HW-504 JOYSTICKS over buttons:** Analogue joysticks give proportional directional intent and a single module covers upto 4 axes axes plus a click, reducing wiring complexity significantly.
- **WS2812B NeoPixel over plain LEDs:** Single-wire addressable RGB allows any colour to be set in one line of code, enabling the full action-colour feedback system without extra PWM pins.
- **MDF/PLA enclosure over cardboard:** Cardboard deforms under joystick force. A rigid enclosure keeps joystick modules fixed at the correct height and separation for comfortable two-thumb grip.

]`

## 12.3 Items to Purchase Separately

| Item | Why Needed | Purchase Link | Latest Safe Date to Procure | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `[Item]` | `[Reason]` | `[Link]` | `[Date]` | `[Pending / Ordered / Received]` |
| `[Item]` | `[Reason]` | `[Link]` | `[Date]` | `[Pending / Ordered / Received]` |

## 12.4 Budget Summary

| Budget Item | Estimated Cost |
|---|---:|
| Electronics | `[Cost]` |
| Mechanical parts | `[Cost]` |
| Fabrication materials | `[Cost]` |
| Purchased extras | `[Cost]` |
| Contingency | `[Cost]` |
| **Total** | `[Cost]` |

## 12.5 Budget Reflection
If your cost is too high, what can be simplified, removed, substituted, or shared?

**Response:**  
`[If cost is too high: drop the one-way mirror installation and present the game on a plain screen — the core BLE controller experience is unaffected. The enclosure can be built from cardboard and hot glue as an interim version while waiting for the laser-cut part.]`

# 13. Planning the Work

## 13.1 Team Working Agreement
Write how your team will work together.

Include:
- how tasks are divided,
- how decisions are made,
- how progress will be checked,
- what happens if a task is delayed,
- how documentation will be maintained.

**Response:**  
`[Tasks are laddered first. Then divide on the basis of time at hand. Tasks are divided into two sections which can be simultaneously worked on. Ideation and Thinking process is done together. The repo keeps us on track and helps us keeping up with time and checks our pace. If the task is delayed due to problems beyond our control we reach out to sources online such as youtube,chatgpt etc. At times we also reach out to our faculty and peers. If a task is delayed, the other member picks up documentation or testing for that area. The documentation is maintained via a notion collaborating app where we write down all tasks, codes, refrence material etc ]`
